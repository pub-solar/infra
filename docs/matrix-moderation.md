# Matrix Moderation using Draupnir

Management room for draupnir: "Matrix Moderators" (Invite-Only)

pub.solar community ban list (aka policy room): shorthand: `ps-bans`, room
alias: `#ban-list:pub.solar`

In the "Matrix Moderators" room, enter `!draupnir help` in the chat to see all
available commands.

If your account has the necessary permissions (moderator) in a room, it's also
possible to use regular moderation actions, e.g. "Kick" / "Ban" provided by your
Matrix client (e.g. Element). The moderation bot will then ask in the management
room, if the kicked / banned account should be added to the `ps-bans` ban list,
to enforce the kick / ban on all pub.solar community rooms.

The bot uses message reactions to control moderation actions.
