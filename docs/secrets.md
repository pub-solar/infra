# Working with secrets

Secrets are handled with [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix). To be able to view secrets, your public key will have to be added to the admins config. See [Administrative Access](./administrative-access.md) on how to do this.

For a comprehensive tutorial, see [the agenix repository](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix?tab=readme-ov-file#tutorial).
